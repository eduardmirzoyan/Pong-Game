# Pong-Game

A recreation of the pong game in python. Decided to start the project after transfering to Berkeley in order to brush up on my python.
Features the classic game of pong with a menu screen, 3 different gamemodes, sounds, score tracking, randomness and nostalgia.

Start the game .py, choose your gamemode and use W/S and Up/Down to control the 2 paddles. This is a two-player game.
